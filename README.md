# Dynamic Pong

**Description:**

"Dynamic Pong" is a modern twist on the classic Pong game, developed using Python and Pygame. This version features dynamic ball speed, challenging gameplay, and two-player action. Players control paddles on either side of the screen and try to prevent the ball from passing their paddle while aiming to score points against their opponent. The ball's speed increases with every collision with the paddles, making the game progressively harder.

**Game Features:**
- Two-player mode with player controls: 
  - Left player uses **W** and **S** to move the paddle.
  - Right player uses **UP** and **DOWN** arrows to move the paddle.
- Dynamic ball speed that increases after each paddle collision, adding difficulty.
- Simple yet engaging gameplay with increasing speed.
- The ball bounces off the top and bottom walls, and players must keep it in play.

**How to Play:**
- Player 1 controls the left paddle with **W** (up) and **S** (down).
- Player 2 controls the right paddle with the **UP** and **DOWN** arrow keys.
- The game is played until one player scores a set number of points (default is 5).
- The ballâ€™s speed increases as it bounces off paddles, making the game faster and more challenging.

**Installation:**
1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
2. Install the Pygame library using the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```
3. Clone or download the repository.
